            We mostly arrived here the 6<sup>th</sup> of january with our new teachers Shaun and Loic, who are our coding teachers, and we were all ready to go through the adventure of this year.

            <h2>A very new topic of study</h2>
        <p>We started to learn Basic IT the 7th. Most of us had never used camputer before coming here but with our eager to know, we did everything to learn it.
        We had our first Basic and Excel test the next week.<br>We  started to learn netwoking, internet, email and browser the following week.<br>These were my favourite, we learnt visual studio code, source control and git the late January.
