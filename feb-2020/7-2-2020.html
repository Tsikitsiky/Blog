                  We started to learn html this week. It is a bit tough but we enjoy doing it. Starting from Monday hitherto, everyone is trying hard to get it.

                  I don't know whether creating this blog is one of our test but I can say that I like doing it. The interesting thing about it is, we created our own repository and then we write our first blog in it and publish it, isn't that interesting?

                  Sometimes, I feel tired during the class, but that feeling is gone when we are starting to exercise. Thanks to our teacher, we always have work to do.
