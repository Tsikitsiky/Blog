            The <time datetime="2020-02-15">15<sup>th</sup> of September 2020</time>, there was a bad weather passing to our town. It was a heavy rain with strong wind, people called it a cyclone, and there was water everywhere seemed like flood. Therefore, we couldn't finish our weekend works last week. As a result, this week we almost couldn't do anything but only finishing our left works.

            It is good to tell you that everyday of our school, our knowledge about the html elements increases. And at the end of this week, we used CSS and javascript for the first time with our html document. It was amazing.
